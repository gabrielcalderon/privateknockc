PrivateKnockC is a companion UDP Port Knocking Client with RSA Encryption for the "privateknockd" project.

*--Usage--*

$> cd privateknockc
$> make
$> privateknockc -s SRV_ADDR -p SRV_PORT -c CONFIG_FILE_PATH

Ex. $> privateknockc -s 192.168.230.0 -p 9090 -c privateknockc.conf

*--Configuration File Format--*

PORT PORT PORT PORT

Each port number must be separated by a space, a port sequence of 4 or more is recommended. 

Ex. 100 200 300 400

TODO List:
1. Send Transaction time via argument.
2. Implement RSA using OPENSSL Library.

The current RSA implementation is based on the RSA Algorithms found in "Mastering Algorithms in C by Kyle Loudon", and as stated in the book its for educational use.
